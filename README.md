## Privacy & Storage
ezBot only stores 2 things. Your Guild ID, and your User ID, ezBot uses [quick.db](https://github.com/plexidev/quick.db) to store this data. This data is then encryped and stored on our VPS. We have a secure SSH Security System & very secure measures put in place. ezBot has only 1 database Administrator, and when accessed, we have logs of everything. Data is encrypted in the database, therefore cannot be read. ezBot only stores your data if you use the bot, for example if you are a Premium User, have set a Custom Prefix, or Logging Channel or have an Inventory in our games category. We **do not** store your email, avatar, or any other data as such in our database. If we do ever update what data we store in our Database, we will immediately notify you via our [Support Server's](https://ez-bot.xyz/r/discord) announcement channel, **on this documentation**, and you will also be able to view it via our `changelog` commmand. 

## I want my data to be deleted, how do I do this?
Please join our [Support Server](https://ez-bot.xyz/r/discord) and contact ez#9999 or Soldr#0001 so we can delete your data from the database. In the future, we may add a `deletedata` command from which you can request to delete your data yourself and it will be immediately deleted, you will only be able to request to delete your data every 24 hours as there is a cooldown. Usually, there should not be a reason to request for your UserID or GuildID to be deleted from our Database, as we cannot do anything from them. These ID's are just  a unique way of identifying you as a user, or your server so we can apply the settings you have selected within the bot, and your profile in other features throughout ezBot. However, if you would still like your data to be deleted, you can contact us as mentioned above and the ezBot Administration Team will be happy to help complete your request.
